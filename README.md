  * **Dynamic Content Generation:** A **Copywriting Agent** automatically writes personalized product descriptions that resonate with the user's unique style and interests.
  * **Intelligent Visual Merchandising:** A **Visual Merchandiser Agent** creates a virtual storefront layout tailored to the user's historical preferences and style analysis.
  * **Style Analysis:** A **Stylist Agent** analyzes a user's style from their social media profiles to understand their fashion preferences.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🏗️ Core Application Stack (MERN+)

This layer handles the traditional web application logic, data persistence, and routing.

* **Frontend:**
* **Next.js (App Router):** The React framework for production-grade web apps, providing server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO and fast initial loads.
* **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety across your agents' data structures.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used by the *Visual Merchandiser Agent* to dynamically style the storefront (e.g., swapping themes from "Cyberpunk" to "Minimalist").


* **Backend:**
* **Node.js & Express.js:** The lightweight execution environment for our AI agents.
* **MongoDB (Mongoose):** Stores persistent user data, like saved style profiles, historical preferences, and cart items.

## 🧠 The "Brain" (AI & Vector Layer)

This is where the personalization magic happens, utilizing state-of-the-art models for 2025.

* **Vector Database:**
* **Weaviate:** A cloud-native vector database that powers your *Aesthetic Vector Space*. It stores product embeddings so the Stylist Agent can find "vibes" rather than just keywords.


* **Text Generation (LLM):**
* **Gemma 3 Flash (via Google AI SDK):** Used by the *Stylist Agent* for fast social media analysis and the *Copywriting Agent* for generating personalized descriptions in real-time.


* **Image Generation:**
* **Imagen 3 / Nano Banana Pro:** A state-of-the-art diffusion model used by the *Visual Agent* to create hyper-realistic, personalized product photography based on user context.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Dev Tools

* **Containerization:**
* **Docker:** Essential for running local instances of Weaviate and ensuring a consistent environment for your micro-services.


* **API Management:**
* **Google Generative AI SDK:** The primary connector for both Gemma (text) and Imagen (images).
* **Weaviate TS Client:** The TypeScript library used for searching and seeding the vector database.


* **Authentication & State:**
* **NextAuth.js:** For secure user login (to link social profiles).
* **React Context / Zustand:** To manage the "Style State" across the frontend.
